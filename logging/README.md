# Centralized Logging (ELK Stack)

This directory contains configuration files for centralized logging using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Includes sample configs for log ingestion, parsing, and visualization. 

# Note on Scalability
This platform is designed to handle high log volumes (10GB+ daily). For production, consider scaling Elasticsearch and Logstash nodes, and using index lifecycle management.
