# GitOps Workflow & Automated Rollback

This project uses a GitOps workflow for infrastructure and application delivery. All changes are made via pull requests and automatically applied by CI/CD pipelines.

## Workflow
1. Developer submits a pull request (PR) with infrastructure or app changes.
2. CI/CD pipeline validates and applies changes to the target environment.
3. Monitoring and alerting are integrated for immediate feedback.
4. If a failure is detected, the pipeline triggers an automated rollback to the previous stable state.

## Automated Rollback
- Rollback is handled by reverting to the last successful deployment commit.
- Rollback scripts and pipeline steps are included in CI/CD configurations.
