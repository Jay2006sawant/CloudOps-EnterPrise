- Multi-cloud support: AWS, Azure, GCP
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation)
- Containerization with Docker & Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE)
- CI/CD integration (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- Automated monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Centralized logging (ELK Stack)
- Security (Vault, IAM, RBAC)
- Networking (VPC, Virtual Networks, Istio)
- Automated backup & disaster recovery
