# Terraform Modules

This directory contains modular Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Each cloud provider will have its own subdirectory with reusable modules and environment-specific configurations.

## Structure
- `aws/`   - AWS modules and environments
- `azure/` - Azure modules and environments
- `gcp/`   - GCP modules and environments

Modules are designed to be composable and follow best practices for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
